Technically speaking, it made sense that Dennis didn\u2019t actually don these for his day job. Aesthetically though, they were dipped in detail that traced back to its muse.

At this point in time, other sneaker giants were also breaking into the NBA with their own basketball sneakers and basketball stars to market them such as Julius Erving with Converse and Walt Frazier with Puma, so Nike definitely had competition in this space.
